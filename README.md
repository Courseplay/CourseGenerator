# Fieldwork Course Generator

The Fieldwork Course Generator is a route planner for farming equipment 
like tractors or harvesters to perform their fieldwork efficiently.

This  Generator is created as part of Courseplay, a mod for the Farming 
Simulator game but it at has no dependency on the game API and can 
run independently.
