# Fieldwork Course Generator

The Fieldwork Course Generator is a route planner for farming equipment 
like tractors or harvesters to perform their fieldwork efficiently.

The Generator is part of Courseplay, a mod for the Farming 
Simulator game but it at has no dependency on the game API and can 
run independently of the game. 

This repository contains everything you need to test the 
Course Generator in a standalone Love2D environment. 

The Course Generator code is in the Courseplay repository, this is 
only the environment, so you'll need to clone the https://github.com/Courseplay/Courseplay_FS22 to
the FS22_Courseplay folder under the root of this repo.
